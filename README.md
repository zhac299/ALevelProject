# A Level Project

A project I developed for my A Level Project. This project consists of a compilation of 4 games I made each of which can be accessed through a single menu. The scores of each game are also recorded in a database where then the Merge Sort Algorithm and Binary Search Algorithm are then applied to allow users to see their scores ranked and compared to others.

Games:
  - Flappy Bird
  - PacMan
  - Space Raider
  - Bling Bling Boy (original idea)
  
This project was made using C# (Unity) and VB.NET
